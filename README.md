# website-stylecheck - Frank Poon's personal website (frankpoon.com) + StyleCheck

## frankpoon.com

My website. Uses mostly HTML and CSS for styling. A small amount of JQuery (nowhere near enough to say I know it) for smooth scrolling.

### Includes:

### index.html

Has 3 sections: about, projects, and contact

### 404.html

404 page.

## StyleCheck

A tool completely built in JavaScript with a HTML frontend. Users upload a Java source file and StyleCheck checks the file for any "style errors" (basically hard to read or inefficient code) and lists each error as output.
