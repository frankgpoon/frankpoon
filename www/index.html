            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Frank. I am currently a Software Engineer at TikTok in New York City, working under the Creator org.</p>
            <p>Before that, I was a SDE at Amazon in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where I worked on a
                platform team dedicated to building tools and systems for engineers and scientists within Alexa AI.</p>
            <p>Before that, I interned at AWS in Seattle, Washington. My project integrated an internal monitoring service
                with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/aws-health-dashboard/">Health Dashboards</a>
                developed by AWS Support.</p>
            <p>Before that, I interned at Choco, a B2B startup in Berlin, Germany. I initially researched chatbots based on my 
                experience building Flashcard Study Buddy (mentioned below), but moved on to general software development; 
                in particular, I developed early backend infrastructure for invoicing.</p>
            <p>I graduated from the University of Washington in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science. At UW, 
                I was also a teaching assistant for <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/">
                CSE 331 (Software Design and Implementation)</a>. One personal project I worked on as a student was 
                <a href="https://frankpoon.com/fsb/">Flashcard Study Buddy</a>,
                an app for Google Assistant that used the Quizlet REST API.</p>
            <p>Outside of my career, I like, in no particular order: rock climbing, sailing, 
                mixing house and techno, Wes Anderson movies, fountain pens, minimalism, 
                and cooking (especially Spanish and Thai food).</p>
