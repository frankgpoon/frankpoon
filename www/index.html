            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Frank. I am a fourth year student at the University of Washington studying
                computer science. I am also a teaching assistant under Hal Perkins for 
                <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/20wi/">CSE 331</a>.</p>
            <p>My website is currently only development oriented as I am off social media at the moment.
                However, feel free to contact me on any of the methods listed below.</p>
            <p>Recently, I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services in Seattle, 
                Washington, specifically in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>. 
                I added integration with a new monitoring service for an internal tool that retrieves data 
                about impacted accounts from AWS monitoring services and sends them to individual 
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/personal-health-dashboard/">
                    Personal Health Dashboards</a>,
                improving communication with AWS customers during operational incidents (a.k.a. downtime).</p>
            <p>Before that, I was a Growth Engineering Intern at a stealth startup in Berlin, 
                Germany, focusing on software development. At this company, I initially focused on
                researching chatbots for their services based on my experience with projects like
                Flashcard Study Buddy, but moved on to building modules for automated data conversion
                between different invoicing formats, adding to the main backend infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Before that, I worked on <a href="https://frankpoon.com/fsb/">Flashcard Study Buddy</a>,
                an app for Google Assistant that used the Quizlet REST API.</p>
            <p>My main go-to programming languages are Java, Python, or JavaScript (specifically node.js). 
                I also know some C and C++. I like general software design, backend development, and 
                building modules with a microservice based approach.</p>
            <p>Outside of CS, I like, in no particular order: rock climbing, mixing techno (something I 
                picked up in Berlin), Wes Anderson movies, fountain pens, minimalism, and cooking
                (especially Spanish and Thai food).</p>
