            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Frank. I am a Software Development Engineer in Cambridge,
                Massachusetts, working on Amazon Alexa. Before that, I was a 
                student at the University of Washington, where I studied
                Computer Science. At UW, I was also a teaching assistant for 
                <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse331/">
                    CSE 331 (Software Design and Implementation)</a>.</p>
            <p>Before joining Alexa, I was a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services in Seattle, 
                Washington, specifically in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support</a>. 
                I added integration with a new monitoring service for an internal tool that retrieves data 
                about impacted accounts from AWS monitoring services and sends them to individual 
                <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/personal-health-dashboard/">
                    Personal Health Dashboards</a>,
                improving communication with AWS customers during operational incidents (a.k.a. downtime).</p>
            <p>Before that, I was a Growth Engineering Intern at a Choco, a B2B startup in Berlin, 
                Germany.  I initially researched chatbots for their services based on my experience 
                with projects like Flashcard Study Buddy, but moved on to software development, building 
                modules for automated data conversion between different invoicing formats and adding to the 
                main backend infrastructure.</p>
            <p>Before that, I worked on <a href="https://frankpoon.com/fsb/">Flashcard Study Buddy</a>,
                an app for Google Assistant that used the Quizlet REST API.</p>
            <p>My main go-to programming languages are Java, Python, or JavaScript (specifically node.js). 
                I also know some C and C++. I like general software design, backend development, and 
                building modules with a microservice based approach.</p>
            <p>Outside of CS, I like, in no particular order: rock climbing, sailing, mixing techno 
                (something I picked up in Berlin), Wes Anderson movies, fountain pens, minimalism, 
                and cooking (especially Spanish and Thai food).</p>
